## Accent Recognition Decision Tree

Data set featuring single English words read by speakers from six different countries for accent detection and recognition.

Decision Tree:

Tree sort of str having node and in each node their is a particular decision based upon whichh the next step will be dicided start from the root node then 
we have the decision nodes and then the leaf nodes which are the results or the action we have to take stoping criteria.

Algorithm used:

The C5.0 decision tree algorithm is used to get the prediction of the accent as it chosses the entrpoy and reduces the entropy.
